YouTube Provider for Faker
---

This package will allow [Faker](https://github.com/FakerPHP/Faker) to generate
fake, but technically valid, YouTube URLs in various formats as well as an embed
HTML.

YouTube's hashing algorithm ensures that the possibility of collisions is really
low, so the chances of a random URI generated by this packge being a real video
is also really low, but not impossible.

## Upgrading to the new Faker?

Since the [original Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) was [sunsetted](https://marmelab.com/blog/2020/10/21/sunsetting-faker.html),
this package was updated to 2.0 to work with the new Faker, bringing along
updated version requirements, which now apply to this package as well.

- `php`: ^7.1 || ^8.0
- `phpunit/phpunit`: ^7.5.20 || ^8.5.8 || ^9.4.2

If you are still using the original Faker, you can continue to use versions 1.x
of this package.
